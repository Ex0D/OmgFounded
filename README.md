# OmgFounded

**Disclaimer :**
* I'm not the owner of the following code (see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN9cWpY5zUc) video)
* I don't encourage anyone to use this script (except to try it to show how easy it is to find an IP on a P2P network)
* I've made a few changes on this script, but nothing very important

**How to use it :**
You just have to copy and paste the script into the browser console at the moment you enter Omegle.
*Don't forget to replace the variable "apiKey" by your token that you can get [here](https://ipgeolocation.io/)*

That's it
